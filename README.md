# EDinPy (ver. Alpha)

## Exact Diagonalization in Python

EDinPy is an efficient package for solving finite, discrete many-body problems using the exact diagonalization technique. EDinPy was built to be as intuitive as possible, such that both students and researchers can quickly write programs without the need to deep-dive into the documentation.

## How to use

EDinPy is currently available on PyPI. You can also find the source code on our github repository, where you'll also find a jupyter notebook with a quick how-to guide. A proper documentation webpage is under devolopment, however can find preliminary htmls files in the docs folder in the repository. 

## Having issues?

Since the documentation is quite poor for the moment, we'll be more than happy to address any issues you may have regarding installation, implementation, and bugs via e-mail, or in the Issues tab on github.
